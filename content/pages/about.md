## Hey, I'm Rakeem :wave:🏾

I'm always down for productive conversation and positive energy. I enjoy solving problems and implementing solutions on the web. I'm a web developer that is currently focused on JavaScript (React, Node, Express, MongoDB, SQL, GraphQL) and tools that exist in the modern JavaScript ecosystem. I'll be using this blog to share knowledge that I gain through studying and breaking things.

I'm currently seeking new job opportunities and I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/rakeemthomas), or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rthom4s). Looking forward to speaking with you! 😀
